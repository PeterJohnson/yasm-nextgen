Welcome to ygas!

This is a repackaged and slimmed down version of yasm that implements only
the GNU as syntax and command line "ygas" frontend and the ELF/DWARF backend.
It is intended for use only on UNIX systems, and can serve as a drop-in
replacement for GNU as by simply renaming "ygas" to "as".

Prerequisites (what you need):

  * A standards-conforming C++ compiler (e.g. GCC 3.4+)
  * Python (http://www.python.org/)

If your C++ installation does not have TR1 functional headers, you will also
need Boost 1.33.1+ (http://www.boost.org/).


Building On UNIX
================

The standard build setup places the object directory separately from the
source.  This makes it easier to clean up any temporary build files as well
as keeps the source directory clean, making revision control systems less
noisy.  The standard place to put this for Yasm is "objdir".

To prepare your working copy for building, run:
  % mkdir objdir
  % cd objdir
  % ../configure

Then to build:
  % make
