TODO list (no particular order):

Key:
- No work done
+ Work started
* Significant work performed

- Translate more object formats from C version:
-   coff/win32/win64
-   dbg
+   elf
-   macho
-   rdf
- Translate debug formats from C version:
-   stabs
-   dwarf2
-   cv8
+ Object format reading core support
- Object format reading for various formats
- Disassembly core support
- x86 disassembly
* "Flattened" expression trees (Expr reimplementation) to reduce memory allocs
- More unit tests
- Optimize align to detect already aligned case and not create new bytecode
  (will need adding align member to bytecode?)
- Optimize org to detect same-offset case and not create new bytecode
- Optimize x86 append_foo functions for less new bytecode creation
- Make object format output const (no modification of Object)
- Translate NASM preprocessor from C version
- Translate GAS parser from C version
- Translate list format support from C version
- Don't install Boost-dependent headers;
  note: will probably always depend on Boost for build (Boost.Pool, Boost.Test)
- Provide separate "mini-Boost" package for easier builds (mainly on Windows)
- Re-examine standard plugin handling: shared lib or like "external" plugin?
- Scan plugin directory and load all plugins present?
- Allow subsetting of standard plugins selection for static builds (yasm-lite)
- Increase Doxygen code documentation coverage
- Improve consistency of pointers vs. references
